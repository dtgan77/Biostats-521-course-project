## Investigation of the Associations Between Telomere Length, Age, and Smoking Status
## Introduction:
The present study aimed to investigate the bivariate relationships between telomere length, age, and smoking status, as well as explore the adjusted associations between age and smoking on telomere length using multiple linear regression. The data were obtained from the telomere.csv file, which contains information on telomere length, age, and smoking status from the 2001-2002 NHANES cohort.
## Methods:
The bivariate relationships between telomere length, age, and smoking status were observed by plotting telomere length against age and smoking. Simple linear regression models were then fitted for telomere length and age, and for telomere length and smoking. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was fitted for telomere length on both age and smoking. Using the simple linear regression results and the results from the MLR model, a table was created to summarize the unadjusted and adjusted associations between age and smoking on telomere length.
## Results:
Result The bivariate analysis showed that telomere length decreased with age, whereas smoking status was not strongly associated with telomere length. However, the simple linear regression analysis revealed that smokers had, on average, telomeres that were longer by 0.038 units than non-smokers. The MLR model results indicated that the effect size for smoking changed dramatically from the simple linear regression model to the MLR model, suggesting that the relationship between smoking and telomere length was confounded by age.
Using the MLR model, linear regression equations were derived for telomere length and age for both smokers and non-smokers. These equations were then used to predict the telomere length for a non-smoking 50-year-old and a 50-year-old smoker. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the effect of age on telomere length was computed while controlling for smoking status, and the 10% Rule of Thumb was applied to determine whether the relationship between smoking and telomere length was confounded by age.
## Conclusion:
The analysis revealed that telomere length decreased with age and that the relationship between smoking and telomere length was confounded by age. The effect size for smoking changed dramatically from the simple linear regression model to the MLR model, indicating that when investigating the associations between telomere length and smoking, it is crucial to account for the confounding effect of age. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of considering age as a critical factor when examining the associations between telomere length, smoking, and health outcomes.
